##Introduction
This repository contains the files to be submitted for Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project. The goal of this course project is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

Dataset: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
Location: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

##Project Details:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

##Requirements
Download the dataset into the working directory and unzip it.
Packages might require: plyr, reshape2, data.table

##Details of the data is in CodeBook.md.
##R Code required is in run_analysis.R.
